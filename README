What you will find here are images as well as precompiled .ipk's for use with a Gumstix Overo Fire and Summit Daughterboard. While I am sure you can use other Overo boards
and daughter boards they as of this point have not been tested. 

Project Goal:

        This is going to be a Angstrom based Linux OS that is setup for PenTesting, site audits, personal survelance from an aerial platform. I would like to get as many 
        ported applications as possible as well as maintaing a very secure OS. At this point the only main use of the overo is as a true on-board computer that interfaces
        with an exsisting Open Source auto pilot system (UAV DevBoard, ArduPilot: currently only ones being tested). I am going for the first and only true OS for this 
        scenario of aerial pentesting, where it could be fully autonomous testing and or predefined recon missions the possibilities are endless. ***More to come**




Operating System Current Info:
OS: Angstrom built with OpenEmbedded
Kernel: Linux-omap-psp_2.6.32
Image: Desktop image that boots as a console 


Apps currently ported and running with full capabilities:   ****Full version numbers will come soon as just going off memory right now***

Native SDK: Full compiling abilities on the overo


Scripts Galore:
There will all types of automatic hack scripts and scenario scripts




How can you help:
Find bugs in any of the scripts and fix or report them, expand the programs, request new feature sets and so on. 


This is a new project posting thats been in development for over a year now and will take roughly another few months to get everything on-line completely and how I want it
Right now is just a sample to get your pallets wet.
